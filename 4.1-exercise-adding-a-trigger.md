### Install Project Management App 
In your developer org, navigate to the AppExchange and install the [Milestones PM Application](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003ItrEEAS).

One we have installed Milestones, click on the Milestones App in your app menu and select the "Initialize App" button.

### Associate Project Object with Opportunity Object
In order to track new projects against Opportunity records, we need to create a relationship between the objects. 

1. Go to **Setup | Create | Objects**
2. Click on the **Project** Custom Object that was created when we installed the Milestones App. 
3. Scroll down the Object details to the Custom Fields section and click **New** 
4. Create a new **LOOKUP** field related to **OPPORTUNITY** 
5. Call this field Opportunity and click **Next** 
6. Make it visible to all users and click **Next** 
7. Leave the "Add to layout" checkbox checked and click **Next** 
8. Leave all related list boxes checked and click **Save**

### Add New Project Trigger
Now that we have related the Opportunity and Project object, we want to add a trigger that will create a new project when an opportunity is marked "closed won"
1. Go to **Setup | Customize | Opportunities|Triggers**

2. Click on **New** to add a new trigger.

3. Select ALL characters in the blank text area, and copy and paste the code below


```
trigger NewProjectTrigger on Opportunity (before update) {
for (Opportunity o : Trigger.new)
{
    if(o.StageName == 'Closed Won')
    {
        try
        {
                Milestone1_Project__c[] proj = [Select Name From Milestone1_Project__c
                        WHERE Opportunity__c = :o.Id];
                Integer i = 0;
                for(Milestone1_Project__c p1:proj)
                {
                    i++;
                }
                if(i == 0) 
                {
                    Milestone1_Project__c p2 = new Milestone1_Project__c(Opportunity__c = o.Id, Name = o.Name);
                    Insert p2;
                }
        }
        catch(Exception e){}    
    }
}
}
```

Once you have pasted your code in, it should look like this

4. Click **Save**


### Test the Trigger
Now test the trigger. Go to an opportunity record and modify it to reflect "Closed Won".

_Line 4 of our trigger says that, the trigger should run when the StageName == 'Closed Won'_


When you mark an existing Opportunity 'Closed Won' you should see a new Project record in the related list. If you click into this new project record, you can see the name was automatically populated based on the opportunity record name.

_Line 17 of our Trigger says that the name of the Project should equal the name of the Opportunity_
